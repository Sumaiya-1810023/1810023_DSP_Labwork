# <h3>Experiment No:4<h3>
# Experiment Name: Study about delay time with correlation.
# Theory:
When a signal sent is sent from a transmitter,suppose the signal arrives at the receiver after being delayed by an unknown interval of time.Now, suppose that we need to find this delay, which is a result of being transmitted over the communication channel. This objective can be achieved by cross-correlating the signal sent with the signal received.
 

# Conclusion:
The graph exhibits a peak at time t = 51.30s. This means that the received signal matches with the test signal the best when the test signal is shifted by 51.30s units along the time-axis.
