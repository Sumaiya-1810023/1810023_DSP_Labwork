# <h3>Experiment No:4</h3>
#<h3> Experiment Name: Study about delay time with correlation.</h3>
#<h3> Theory:</h3>
When a signal sent is sent from a transmitter,suppose the signal arrives at the receiver after being delayed by an unknown interval of time.Now, suppose that we need to find this delay, which is a result of being transmitted over the communication channel. This objective can be achieved by cross-correlating the signal sent with the signal received.
 

#<h3> Conclusion:</h3>
The graph exhibits a peak at time t = 51.30s. This means that the received signal matches with the test signal the best when the test signal is shifted by 51.30s units along the time-axis.
